# Implementation Graph Algorithm to python code

## How To Use This Code ?
- First, download zip or clone the repository.
- Second, you have to install the module python
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
- Third, choose what graph algorithm you want to use.
- Fourth, run graph algorithm file.

## Goals from this Project : 
This project aims to create a python system for learning graph theory using networkx python module. 

## Information about graph algorithm :
1. file shortest tak berarah.py is an graph algorithm that can find the shortest path from node to another node (directionless).
2. file shortest berarah.py is an graph algorithm that can find the shortest path from node to another node (with direction).
3. file circuit tak bearah.py is an algorithm focused on finding closed paths that start and end at the same vertex, without repeating the same edge more than once (directionless).
4. file circuit bearah.py is an algorithm focused on finding closed paths that start and end at the same vertex, without repeating the same edge more than once (with direction).
5. file Krackhardt Centrality.py is a measure for each node in a graph to compare how central that node is to all the other nodes in the same graph.
6. file maximumindependentgraph.py is an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph where no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The maximum independent set is the independent set of largest possible size for a given graph.
7. file subgraph.py is used to find subgraphs within graphs, or to determine if one graph contains a subgraph of another graph. Subgraph algorithms can be used for graph differencing, graph alignment, and more.
